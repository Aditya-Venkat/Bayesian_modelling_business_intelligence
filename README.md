# Bayesian_modelling_business_intelligence
This repository contains all codes and reports relevant to the project titled "Bayesian Modeling of Networks in Complex Business Intelligence Problems" done as a part of the course MTH422 : An introduction to Bayesian Analysis - IIT Kanpur. 

# Guide
Sim.R : For dataset simulation
Algo.R : Contains code for the MCMC algorithm implemented. This also contains the code to reproduce the trace plot.
Visualizations.R : Produces the other plots and results in the report.
If variables seem to be missing while running Visualizations.R, please run Sim.R and Algo.R first
